<hr />

I am an associate professor in the Department of Biostatatstics and Bioinformatics at Emory University.
My research has mainly focused on bioinformatics and computational biology.
Our research group develop statistical methods and computational
tools for analyzing large scale biomedical data, in particular high-throughput omics data. Our methodological contribution includes novel methods and tools for analyzing data from RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, bisulfite sequencing, cell-free DNA, and estimating and accounting for sample heterogeneity in high-throughput data. My work has been published on influential journals such as Nature Method, Nature Genetics, Genome Research, and Genome Biology. We developed a number of open source software tools. We have contributed several packages freely available on Bioconductor, with over 30,000 combined downloads annually. See [Publication](http://www.haowulab.org//pages/pubs.html) and [Software](http://www.haowulab.org//pages/software.html) pages for detail. 


In recent a couple years, I also started to work on other types of biomedical big data from electronic health record (EHR) and mobile device. We are developing methods for disease prediction and individulized treatment design. 

We collaborate closely with clinicians and scientists to characterize different types of genomics and epigenomics modifications in human diseases (including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Fragile X syndrome, HIV), in order to discover diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 


<p>
I joined the department in 2010 after obtaining my Ph.D.
degree in Biostatistics from the
<a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a>,
under the guidances of professors
<a href="http://rafalab.github.io/">Rafael Irizarry</a> and
<a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji">Hongkai Ji</a>.
I became an associate professor (with tenure) in September 2016.
