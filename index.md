<hr />



<p>I am an associate professor in the Department of Biostatatstics and Bioinformatics at Emory University.
My research has been mainly focused on bioinformatics and computational biology.
I'm particularly interested in developing statistical methods and computational
tools for interpreting large scale genomic data from high-throughput
technologies such as microarrays and second generation sequencing.
<p>
I am also interested in general machine learning, pattern recognition and
large scale data mining methods with applications to biomedical data.
I collaborate closely with researchers working on epigenetics to characterize 
different types of DNA methylation and histone modifications.

<p>
I joined the department in 2010 after obtaining my Ph.D.
degree in Biostatistics from
<a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a>,
under the guidances of professors
<a href="http://rafalab.github.io/">Rafael Irizarry</a> and
<a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji">Hongkai Ji</a>.
I became an associate professor (with tenure) in September 2016.
