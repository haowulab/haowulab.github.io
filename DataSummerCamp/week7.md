1. Read in the COVID-19 data, provide R codes and results for the following questions: 
		
	- Generate an animated figure to show the total number of confirmed and death cases in the US by date. I expect to see a figure similar to the following:

	- Do the same (animated figure) for daily new confirmed and death cases in the US.

### Day 1: R animation 

Learn how to generate animation in R graphics. Let me know if this is difficult.

- Do homework question 1. 

### Day 2: Tidyr and readr 

You have learned some basic skills in manipulating data in R. 
Today, we will learn some more advanced and convenient packages 
for handling data: Tidyr and readr. I have to admit that I don't know these packages very well myself. These are newer packags. I knew the old ways of doing things well, and am lazy to learn new things. 

- Tidyr and readr are packages in `tidyverse`. Browse [https://www.tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org)  a little to get to know it. 
- Read the class slides for [tidyr and readr](tidyr_readr.html).
