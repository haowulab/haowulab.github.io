### Homework

1. Read in the COVID-19 data, provide R codes and results for the following questions: 

	- Take out the data for the US, compute the numbers for new confirmed and death cases for each day (using the `diff` function). Visualize the results in a figure. 
		
		
	- Generate an animated figure to show the number of confirmed and death cases in the US by date. I expect to see a figure similar to the following:

### Day 1: Miscellaneous R functions 

Today we will learn some R functions useful for the analysis of COVID-19 data.

- The `Date` class in R: [https://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html)](https://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html), [https://riptutorial.com/r/topic/9015/the-date-class](https://riptutorial.com/r/topic/9015/the-date-class). 
- The `diff` function: read the function help and play with the examples. In the meantime, you can also play with the `cumsum` function.
- The `matplot` function. You have used this before. Read the function help and play with the examples to reinforce the memory. 



### Day 2: R animation 

Learn how to generate animation in R graphics. Let me know if this is difficult.
