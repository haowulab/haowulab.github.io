title: Schedule for week 7
---

It seems the contents in weeks 5 and 6 are too heavy. I'll make this week a little more relaxing and fun. 



### Homework

1. Read in the COVID-19 data, provide R codes and results for the following questions: 
		
	- Generate an animated figure to show the total number of confirmed and death cases in the US by date. I expect to see a figure similar to the following: 
	
	<img src="covid19-US.gif" style="width:400px;"/>

	- Do the same (animated figure) for daily new confirmed and death cases in the US.
