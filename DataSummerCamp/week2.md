### Homework

For the homework, you need to submit two files: a markdown file named homework2.md, and an R file named  homework2.R. 

In **homework2.md**, answer following questions: 

- Show the R codes and figures you generated for histogram, boxplot, barplot, and scatter plot. 
- Provide a brief summary of the COVID-19 data set. 
	- What information does it contain? 
	- How many rows and columns are there? 
	- How many countries does it have? 
	- How many days does it have? 
 

In **homework2.R**:

- compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of integers from 1 to 10.
- Create a list with a vector and a matrix. Give each element in the list a name. Use different ways to take the elements out of the list.  
- Make up some exmples to generate histogram, boxplot, barplot, and scatter plot. Save the figures as pdf. 
- Read the [COVID-19 data](data/covid_19_clean_complete.csv) into R as a data frame. 
- Briefly summarize the data to get the number of countries and days included in the data set. You might need the ``table`` or ``unique`` functions. Read their function helps. 

### Day 1: Review and basic statistics
- [https://www.guru99.com/r-data-types-operator.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-data-types-operator.html)
- [http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics), the first 5 sections (up to **Vectors**)
- [https://www.guru99.com/r-matrix-tutorial.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-matrix-tutorial.html).
- Understand the meaning of important statistics quatities: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. Google the internet for these definition. You can read wikipedia, the beginning section for each. In addition, [https://www.mathsisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/mean.html) seems to be easier to read. 
- Learn to use R to compute the important statistics: functions are ``mean``, ``median``, ``var``, ``sd``. Read the function helps and play with the examples. 


### Day 2: R package, and markdown
- Read [https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide), the first 6 sections. 
- Install following packages in your R: **ggplot2**, **vioplot**.
- Learn how to insert figure in markdown, 

### Day 3: R data frame and list 
**List**:

- Read [http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics#lists](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics#lists). 
- Read [https://www.guru99.com/r-lists-create-select.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-lists-create-select.html). 

**Data frame**:

- Read [http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics#data-frames](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics#data-frames), 
- Read [https://www.guru99.com/r-data-frames.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-data-frames.html). 

### Day 4: R file I/O
- Understand the tab-delimited and csv file format: read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values). 
- Learn to read in files to R: [https://www.guru99.com/r-import-data.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-import-data.html). 
- Read the [COVID-19 data](data/covid_19_clean_complete.csv) into R. 

### Day 5: Basic R graphics

- Learn to use R to create [histogram](https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/density.html), [boxplot](https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/boxplot.html), [scatter plot](https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/scatterplot.html), [bar plot](https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/bar.html). 
- Learn to save R plots in files: [http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/creating-and-saving-graphs-r-base-graphs](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/creating-and-saving-graphs-r-base-graphs). 
- Understand the meaning of each figure. Read the function helps for these functions, and play with the examples. Have a rough idea of the function parameters (what you can control for the figures).
- Browse [https://www.r-graph-gallery.com](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com) to see what type of figures R can generate.
