### Homework

I will list the homework at the begining of each weekly schedule, so that you have a better idea of what you need to do. 

For the homework, you need to submit two files: a markdown file named homework1.md, and an R file named  homework1.R. 

In **homework1.md**, answer following questions: 

1. What Markdown editor did you choose, and why?
2. Write a summary of what you learned this week, using markdown. Name the file homework1.md. Using different type of fonts, and ordered/unordered list. 

In **homework1.R**:

1. Provide all the R code you tried this week. 
2. Write R program to do the following. _NOTE: if you haven't learned, the functions for computing sum and mean of vector/matrix is ``sum`` and ``mean``. Look at their function helps if needed._ 
	- Compute the sum and mean of integers from 1 to 10.
	- Create a vector of 5 elements, you can put in some random numbers in the vector. Take out the 2nd **to** 4th elements, and compute their sum and mean. 
	- Create a vector of 5 elements, you can put in some random numbers in the vector. Take out the 2nd **and** 4th elements, and compute their sum and mean. 
	- Create a 3x3 matrix, you can put in some random numbers in the matrix. Compute the sum and mean of each row and column.
	- Create two vectors, each with 3 elements. Compute the sum and difference of each element in the vector.
	- Create two vectors, each with 3 elements, combine them into one vector of 6 elements. 
	- Create two vectors, each with 3 elements, (1) combine them into a 2x3 matrix; (2) combine them into a 3x2 matrix.

### Day 3: R and R studio
- Understand the "directory" on computer. Setup your R working directory by reading [http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/running-rstudio-and-setting-up-your-working-directory-easy-r-programming](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/running-rstudio-and-setting-up-your-working-directory-easy-r-programming). 
- Start to learn R programming language: [https://www.guru99.com/r-data-types-operator.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-data-types-operator.html). Play the examples in R by copying/pasting the command into R and see the results. 
- Learn how to get function helps in R by reading [http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/getting-help-with-functions-in-r-programming](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/getting-help-with-functions-in-r-programming).

### Day 4: R programming 
- Review basic R programming: read [http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics), the first 5 sections (up to **Vectors**). Play with the examples.
- Understand the concept of matrix. If you don't know it, google "matrix" and look it up. 
- Learn R matrix at [https://www.guru99.com/r-matrix-tutorial.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-matrix-tutorial.html).
