title: Data science for high schooler
---

This is a detailed learning plan for a high schooler (sophomore and above) during an 8-week period. Students are expected to have basic knowledge about programming and statistics. The workload is 2-3 hours per day during the weekday. 

***

### Learning objective
To develop essential skills for data analysis, including visualization, summarization, basic statistical inference, and generating report. 

***

### Content

#### Basic statistics knowledge
- Understand data format: vector and matrix
- Understand concept of data distribution. 
- Summary statistics: mean, meian, variance, standard deviation, proportions.
- Understand concept of data visualization and their relationship with data distribution and summary statistics: boxplot, histogram, scatter plot, bar plot.
- Concept of correlation and contingency table. 
- Basic statistical inference: two group t- and z-test, simple linear regression.


#### Programming language
- **R**: for data analyses and visualization
	- Basic usage of Rstudio
	- Using R console for basic numeric computation. 
	- Understand R data types including vectors, matrix, data frame
	- File input and output: how to read in files and write results out. 
	- Basic R graphics, and how to output R figures to file. 
	- Basic data analyses: compute summary statistics, simple statistical test, linear regression. 

- **markdown** and **Rmarkdown**: for writing reports.
	- Create markdown files, convert to pdf and/or html.
	- Basic commands for different type of format
	- How to include figures in the document
	- How to include Latex style equations 
- A littlt bit of **Latex**. 
	- I don't expect students to write standalone latex document, but they need to know how to use latex to write equations, and insert those in Rmarkdown documents. 

#### Data analysis
- Analyze a dataset for COVID-19. 
- Write a final report in the standard format of a scientific paper.
