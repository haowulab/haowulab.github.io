description: Hao Wu's Short bio
---

I was born in Beijing and grew up in Tianjin, China. 
I graduated from the <a href="http://www.nkzx.cn/">Tianjin Nankai High School</a>, 
which produced two Chinese prime ministers and numuerous scientists. 
I received my BS degree from 
[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn),
Department of Electrical Engineering in 1996 and MS degree from [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu)
Department of Electrical Engineering in 2000.

In early 2000 I started to work in a branch of 
[GE Energy](http://www.gepower.com)
as an engineer. I was in a team to develop and customize software
for power system controls and optimizations. 
The everyday work was C and Fortran programming. 
In mid 2001, my wife got her Ph.D. in genetics and
found a job in Maine. I quitted my job and moved with her.

From July 2001 to August 2005,
I worked as a scientific software engineer 
at The Jackson Laboratory](http://www.jax.org). 
in [Dr. Gary Churchill's statistical genetics group](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-churchill-lab). 
I learnt a lot in those four
years through my work, and was exposed to the fancinating world of genetic and genomic research. 
I developed and co-developed
several software packages for QTL mapping and gene expression microarray
data analysis during that time. See <a href="software.html">Software page</a> for details.
I became a senior software engineer in early
2005 and felt the learning curve was saturated as a scientific programmer.
I had an urge to go back to graduate school and
study math/statistics and biology in a systematical and rigorous way. 
My major career goal at that time was to find an 
academic position and conduct independent research on
biostatistics/bioinformatics/computational biology. 

My five-year Ph.D. study was full of struggle, depression, sleepless nights, 
as well as enjoyment. I obtained my degree in 2010, and fortunately found a tenure track faculty position at Emory. 
Since then I have been fully enjoying the academic freedom and 
intellectual challenges, and working on problems I'm interested in.


In my leisure time I listen to music and [play a little guitar](https://soundcloud.com/user-240749812/hotel-california-42420-1059-pm). My favorite guitarist is Slash, so of course my favoriate band is G&R. I'm trying to learn many Slash's solos. I like sports and enjoy watching American football (both college and the NFL). I enjoy running (trying to run 30-40 miles a week if I have time), and go to gym regularly. I also play soccer and tennis a few times a week. Above all these, 
I especially enjoy playing tennis with my
two boys (both are good athletes and way better than me), and watching them play in the tournaments.
