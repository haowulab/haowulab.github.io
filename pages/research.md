description: Hao Wu's research

I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician with formal training in biostatistics.
My research has been mainly focused on developing statistical methods and computational tools
for analyzing and interpreting large-scale biological or clinical data, in particlar the high-throughput omics data.
<br>

At this moment, I spent most of my time on developing methods and tools for
analyzing data from various types of second generation sequencing experiments,
including:

- [RNA-seq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq/): differential expression, 
power and sample size calculation, 
single cell RNA-seq. 
- [ChIP-seq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP-sequencing):
peak calling, differential binding.
- [BS-seq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing): differential methylation.


On the application side, I'm very interested in epigenetic regulation of
gene expressions and their associations with  different types
of diseases. I closely collaborate with basic scientists and clinicians
to study different types of DNA/RNA methylation and histone modifications.
