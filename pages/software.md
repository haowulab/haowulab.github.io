Here is a list of software packages I developed or co-developed. 
<br>

#### Bioconductor packages 

- [DSS](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html) (**D**ispersion **S**hrinakge for **S**equencing): differential analysis for count-based sequencing data. It detectes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq, and differentially methylated loci or regions (DML/DMRs) from bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). 

- [PROPER](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PROPER.html) (**PRO**spective **P**ower **E**valuation for **R**NAseq): simulation based methods for evaluating the statistical power in differential expression analysis from RNA-seq data. 

- [ChIPComp](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPComp.html): Differntial protein binding analysis for ChIP-seq data. The package can potentially be used for differntial analyses from other capture sequencing data with controls such as m6A capture or Ribo-seq data. 
- [maanova](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maanova.html): Differntial expression analysis of N-dye microarray experiments using mixed model effect. 

<br>
#### Other non-bioconductor software
- [JAMIE](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/jamie/) (**J**oint **A**nalysis of **M**ultiple **I**P **E**xperiments).
- [makeCGI](): finding [CpG islands] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island) (CGIs) from DNA sequences.
- [R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org): mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in experimental crosses. 
- [J/qtl](http://churchill.jax.org/software/jqtl.shtml): a Java graphical user interface (GUI) for R/qtl.
