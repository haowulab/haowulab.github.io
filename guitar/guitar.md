## My guitar playing chronicles

### Background

* I played a couple years of guitar in college (1992-1994 or so). Mostly folk songs on acoustic, a little bit classic (like Romance and B minor sonata by sor). 
* I know the simple chords, like the majors, minors, 7th, some barre chords, on low fret. 
* Understand basic music theory. Can read tabs and simple staff. 
* Can play diatonic scales in C and G major, again on low frets. 

Now (early 2020) after 26 years, I come back to guitar playing and really want to improve my skills. I'm dedicated, displined, and patient. This document is to chronicle my guitar playing endeavor.  

I think I'm physically pretty untalented, with short and thick fingers. But my music sense is reasonably good, with very good rhythm, and pretty good ears. 

### Equipment

As of April 2020, I have:

* Acoustic: Ovation Celebrity. Get it for $200 used at Guitar Center. It doesn't sound particularly good, but has very low action and easy to play. I think it's a good practice guitar. 
* Classic: Ibanez GA5TCE with nylon string, for $200 or so used on Craig's list with hard case. I think it's surprisingly good. I like the small body. 
* Electric: PRS SE custom 24. Get it for $750 new at Guitar Center. I initially bought a Epiphone Les Paul (Gibson is too expensive), but didn't really liked it. The PRS feels really smooth, with long sustaining sound which I like. 
* Amp: Ibanez 40W. I don't pay attention to the model number. Get it for $100 or so used on Craig's list. It has a mic input so I can sing with it :-)



### April 2020
Now we are at home quarantined for COVID-19, so I have a lot of time to play. For the past month, I played about 3-4 hours everyday, 80% time on electric. 

#### My usual routines


* Fundamental practices, including spider walks, scales, arpeggios, string bending, vibrato, legato, etc. Usually for 1-2 hours. 
* Learn and practice new songs. Mostly on YouTube. Usually for 1-2 hours. 
* Free playing. One hour or so. 

#### My speed

All speed measures are on the electric guitar. All numbers are measured on after warming up (for 15-20 minutes) 

* **Potential picking speed (PPS)**. I hold on, say, 9th fret on 2nd string, no fret finger change, and pick as fast as I can. About 180 bpm 1/16 notes (4 notes per beat). 
* **Simplest spider walks** (like 1234 on one string, not string change): about 200 bpm 1/8 notes (2 notes per beat).
* **Simple spider walks** (like 1234, 4321 on all strings): about 180 bpm 1/8 notes (2 notes per beat).
* **Harder spider walks** (like 1324, 4231, 1243, 4312, on all strings): about 160 bpm 1/8 notes (2 notes per beat).
*  **Even harder spider walks** (like 1324 on different strings) 
*  **Diatonic scales**: 
*  **Pantatonic scales (all 5 shapes)**:
*  **String skip**, such as the intro in Sweet child o'mine: 


#### What I can play

* November rain solo (not the outro).  Played reasonably well because it's slow (78 bpm). 
* Hotel california intro solo (from Hell freeze over). I play this reasonably well on acoustic. 
* Hotel california ending solo. Can play the whole thing on lower speed, like 80 bpm. I play some places better, have trouble with the bend-release-pull off part, the start part of Joe Walsh.  
* Part of some other solos, like Sweet child o'mine, Smoke on the water, etc. I can play the slow parts.
* Some famous licks, like Stairways to heaven, wonderful tonight, etc. 


#### Some random thoughts

* My bottleneck for playing more solos is the speed. I need to be patient on fundamentals, not to jump into things like Eruption. 
* I play too much electric, and it seems my acoustic skills are getting worse. Electric is too easy to fret, not good for my acoustic fretting. I need to play more acoustic to keep up my finger strength. Maybe run the spider walks and scales on acoustic. 
* I should learn more licks to build up my music library. 
* Probably should play a little more finger style on acoustic. 
* Now I completely abandoned classic. 
* I really like Slash. Like his music, for example Godfather theme or Anastasia. Also really like Sultan of swings by Dire Straight. Wish I can play these some day. I kind of like Jimmy Page. Not a huge fan of Eric Clapton, for his music is kind of bluesy.
